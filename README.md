Lexical pronunciation resources for TTS in South African languages
==================================================================

This repo contains lexical pronunciation resources and modules for use
in text-to-speech systems.

Specifically, the repository was originally set up to track work on
updating and enhancing existing resources for the NTTS project funded
by the _Department of Arts and Culture_ (DAC) of the Government of
South Africa.
